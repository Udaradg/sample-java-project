## Narrative

**Issue** — reported as Medium severity: [docs/agent_output/00-issues/issue-register.xlsx](../../docs/agent_output/00-issues/issue-register.xlsx) (ISSUE-004 row) documents `employee-service/pom.xml` pinning `org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml` at 5.0.0, affected by CVE-2025-31672 (no uniqueness check on ZIP entry paths when loading an OOXML archive), exercised directly on caller-uploaded bytes via `ExcelUploadImpl.getEmployeeDataFromExcel`.

**Root cause** — [docs/agent_output/02-root-cause/root_cause_ISSUE-004.md](../../docs/agent_output/02-root-cause/root_cause_ISSUE-004.md): the pinned 5.0.0 version is what parses uploads reaching `POST /api/v1/employee/excelUpload`, with only a spoofable client-supplied Content-Type check (`ExcelUploadImpl.isValidExcelFile`) in front of it.

**Blast radius** — [docs/agent_output/03-blast-radius/blast_radius_ISSUE-004.md](../../docs/agent_output/03-blast-radius/blast_radius_ISSUE-004.md): scope `endpoint`, P3 — confined to the one upload path; every other employee-service endpoint and every other service is unaffected.

**Fix plan** — [docs/agent_output/04-remediation/fix_plan_ISSUE-004.md](../../docs/agent_output/04-remediation/fix_plan_ISSUE-004.md), Approved. Cites the CWE-1104 catalog pattern ("Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components"): bump to the advisory's own minimum fixed version (5.4.0), not "latest"; explicitly rejected adding structural upload validation in this diff as a separate, out-of-scope follow-up.

**Fix drafted** — [docs/agent_output/04-remediation/fix_ISSUE-004.md](../../docs/agent_output/04-remediation/fix_ISSUE-004.md), 1 file changed (`employee-service/pom.xml`, a single `<version>` line), matches the plan. The Dependency Upgrader's own declared-version check passed (5.4.0, matching target); its compile step reports Compile Failed — see build note below.

**Step 1 verification** (parallel, static/reasoning): re-scan [FIXED](../../docs/agent_output/05-verify/rescan_ISSUE-004.md) — the patched pom.xml declares 5.4.0, outside the advisory's affected range; red-team [NO_BYPASS_FOUND](../../docs/agent_output/05-verify/redteam_ISSUE-004.md) — checked the fix against every anti-pattern in the CWE-1104 catalog entry and found none, though it named a real, plan-acknowledged residual gap (no structural upload validation independent of the pinned version); behavior-guard [BEHAVIOR_PRESERVED](../../docs/agent_output/05-verify/behavior_ISSUE-004.md) — the diff is a single version string in one non-code file.

**Step 2 gates**: QA [Failed](../../docs/agent_output/06-test-gate/qa_ISSUE-004.md) and build gate [Failed](../../docs/agent_output/06-test-gate/build_ISSUE-004.md) — both fail on the same pre-existing, project-wide JDK25/Lombok compile mismatch already documented for ISSUE-001/002/003. The compiler errors are entirely inside `ExcelUploadImpl.java`'s calls to Lombok-generated `Employee` setters — a file this dependency-only patch never touches (only `pom.xml` and a newly-added test file were changed).

**Score and decision** — [docs/agent_output/07-ship/verdict_ISSUE-004.md](../../docs/agent_output/07-ship/verdict_ISSUE-004.md): computed score 60/100 against a 75 threshold (Medium severity), build-gatekeeper hard gate tripped, decision **Blocked**. Under this pipeline's current arbitration rules, an override may only ever move a computed `Cleared` decision to the more conservative `Blocked` — it can never clear a computed `Blocked` decision, regardless of evidence. No override was applied; the computed Blocked decision stands as-is.
